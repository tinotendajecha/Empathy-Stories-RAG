1,"Once, there was a conversation between two individuals. The first posed a seemingly straightforward question to the other: ""Do you agree that water always assumes the shape of its container?"" The second, without hesitation, affirmed, ""Yes, of course.""

Pleased with the quick agreement, the first continued, ""So, you're saying that water inherently has the property to adapt to any shape it's introduced to?"" Again, the second replied, ""Yes.""

However, the first then introduced a twist, ""But at what temperature did you assume the water to be?"" This question prompted a moment of reflection. ""I didn't specify, did I? You might have automatically thought of water in its liquid state, not considering its form at 0 degrees Celsius, where it freezes, or at 100 degrees Celsius, where it boils and becomes steam. In both these conditions, the idea of water taking the shape of its container doesn't quite fit.""

The moral drawn was illuminating: ""Often, we don't consider the entirety of a situation, making assumptions based on our initial perspective without questioning the conditions that might change the outcome. It's a reminder of the value in viewing problems from multiple angles before drawing conclusions.""",,"{

2,"Just before his death, a billionaire became aware that he had never experienced bliss. He must have been fortunate. Some people become aware only after death. He became aware before death that he had not experienced bliss. Death was close-by. Astrologers said, “There are not many days left, be quick.” He said, “I have been hurrying all my life but where is bliss? And now I have the means to buy it. I am ready to buy it at any cost.” Those astrologers said, “That we do not know. We can only say that hurry because death is close-by. And if you come to know, then let us know also because we will also have to hurry, death is close-by. But he said, “But where should I look for it?” They said, “We don’t know. You just go look for it, anywhere, just look for it.
He climbed his fastest horse. He put diamonds, jewels worth crores of rupees on his horse and then going to each and every village started shouting, “If somebody gives me a glimpse of bliss then I am ready to give him all this.”
Then he reached a village, where there was a Sufi fakir. The people of the village said, “You have come to the right place. There is a man in this village who solves this kind of absurd problems.” He said, “Absurd problems!” The people of that village said, “We have also learnt a few absurd things by being in his company. One thing we have learnt, it is quite absurd absurd because nobody can buy even a glimpse of bliss with money, bliss is very far away. But still you have come, you did right. You have come to the right place. There is such a man in this village.
That man was searched for. The villagers took the billionaire to him. That Sufi fakir, Nasruddin was sitting under a tree. The sun was setting. The villagers said, “This is that man.” That billionaire threw down his bag full of gold and diamonds, jewels, and said, “I am ready to give all this. There is wealth worth crores in it. I want a glimpse of bliss.” That fakir looked at him from top to bottom. He said, “You want a true glimpse?” He said, “Yes, a true glimpse.” He was able to utter only that much, when the fakir grabbed the bag and ran away. For a moment that rich man stood there dumb-founded and then started crying, “I am ruined, I am dead.” But till then the fakir had gone far away into the darkness. The villagers knew that fakir, that he would do something absurd. They said, “We told you right in the beginning that this is the man who can answer absurd questions.” The rich man said, “Is this an answer! Catch him!” The people ran. The rich man also ran. The village was known to that fakir. He started eluding them by running through the alleys. The whole village woke up. He eluded everybody just to wake up the whole village. Then the whole village was running. Then running he came to the same place, the tree under which the horse was standing. He threw the bag down from where he had picked it up and stood under the tree. The rich man, huffing, puffing, perspiring, reached there. He saw the bag, picked it up, hugged it and said to god, “A great thanks to you!” That fakir said from behind the tree, “Did you get a glimpse?” The rich man said, “Yes, I definitely did. I experienced great bliss.” That fakir said, “So now get on your horse and go.”
The thing that we own, until we lose that also, we do not know. The whole journey of this world is of losing that which we have to attain. What we already have, we are not aware of it till we lose it once. We have lost it, we will have to search for it.

3,"In the midst of a vibrant and enlightening conversation, one individual posed a thought-provoking question to another, their words floating in the air like the delicate dance of leaves in a gentle breeze. ""Consider this,"" they began, their voice painting the scene with intrigue, ""when constructing a magnificent residence, one might select the finest of materials—Italian marble that whispers tales of ancient elegance, Persian carpets that carry the secrets of distant lands, and perhaps, chandeliers that scatter light as if capturing the stars themselves. But, amidst this opulence, could one truly call it a home if it lacked the humble yet essential amenities, like a toilet and sewage system?""

The question lingered, a soft challenge to preconceived notions of beauty and necessity. ""No matter the grandeur of the abode,"" they continued, a knowing look in their eyes, ""whether it be a quaint cottage by the stream or a sprawling estate that kisses the sky, the need for these basic conveniences remains unchanged. They are, in their unassuming way, the very backbone of a home's functionality.""

The conversation took a turn, deeper into reflection. ""Life, in all its complexity and splendor, operates much in the same way. While we chase the extraordinary, dreaming of achievements as dazzling as the finest jewels, we mustn't overlook the foundational elements, the 'dirty work,' that keeps the very essence of our existence in balance. Just as a home cannot do without a place to attend to our basic needs, our aspirations and successes are hollow without the groundwork that sustains them.""

The lesson was clear, distilled from the imagery of constructing a home but resonating far beyond. ""In every endeavor, remember the importance of the essentials. For it is they that truly allow the extraordinary to shine, grounding us in reality while we reach for the stars.""","General Information

4,"One morning, you decide to take a walk, finding unexpected joy in the simplicity of the moment. Eager to share this experience, you tell your friend about the tranquility and satisfaction you found. Intrigued, your friend agrees to join you the next day. However, as you both walk, your friend keeps wondering every few minutes, ""When will I start to enjoy this?"" This constant anticipation prevents him from truly embracing the experience. This story serves as a profound reminder: the pursuit of something better or the anticipation of future joy often distracts us from the beauty of the present.

7,"Two disciples of a great Master were walking in the garden of the Master’s house. They were allowed to walk every day, morning, evening. The walking was a kind of meditation, a walking meditation — just as Zen people do walking meditation. You cannot sit for twenty-four hours — the legs need a little movement, the blood needs a little circulation — so in Zen and in Sufism both, you meditate for a few hours sitting and then you start meditating walking. But the meditation continues; walking or sitting, the inner current remains the same.
They both were smokers. They both wanted to ask for the permission of the Master, so they both decided, “Tomorrow. At the most, he will say no, but we are going to ask. And it doesn’t seem such a sacrilegious act to smoke in the garden; we will not be smoking in his house itself. ”
The next day they met in the garden. One was furious — furious because the other was smoking — and he said, “What happened? I also asked, but he simply flatly refused and said no. And you are smoking? Are you not abiding by his orders?”
He said, “But he has said yes to me.
“This looked very unjust. And the first said, “I will go and immediately inquire as to why he said no to me and yes to you.”
The other said, “Wait a minute. Please tell me what you had asked.” He said, “What I had asked? I had asked a simple thing, ‘Can I smoke while meditating?’ He said, ‘No!’ and he looked very angry. ”
The other started laughing; he said, “Now I know what is the matter. I asked, ‘Can I meditate while smoking?’ He said ‘yes.'”
It all depends. Just a little difference, and life is totally something else. Now, there is a great difference. Asking, “Can I smoke while meditating?” is just ugly. But asking, ” Can I meditate while smoking?” — it’s perfectly okay. Good! At least you will be meditating.

Life is neither misery nor bliss. Life is an empty canvas, and one has to be very artistic about it.","General Information

8,"Confucius happened to pass by. He saw the old man and his young son, yoked together pulling water from the well. He was filled with compassion. He went up to the old man and said: “Do you not know, you foolish fellow, that now we harness horses or oxen to do this job? Why are vou unnecessarily tiring yourself and this young boy?”

The old man said, “Hush! Pray speak softly lest my son hears! Come after some time when my boy goes for lunch.” Confucius was perplexed. When the youth left, he asked the old man, “Why would you not let your son hear what I said?” He replied, “I am 90 years old and yet I have the strength to work side by side with a youth of 30. If I engage horses to pull the water, my son will not have the same strength at 90, that I have now. So I pray to you, do not talk of this before my son. It is a question of his health. We have heard that in towns, the horses pull water from the well. We also know that there are machines that do this job as well. But then, what will my son do? What will happen to his health, his constitution?”

What we do on one hand has an immediate effect on the other.

If Lao Tzu is correct, the result will be disastrous. For example: We want to sleep soundly. He who wishes to sleep soundly is, inveritably fond of rest. And he who does not toil, cannot sleep soundly. Lao Tzu says, “Work and rest are both united. If you wish to relax, toil hard.” Strive so hard that relaxation falls on you. Now if we think the Aristotalean way, work and rest are different and opposite. If I am fond of rest and comfort, and wish to sleep soundly, I shall just sit around the whole day and do nothing. But he who rests in the day, destroys his repose of the night. Rest has to be earned through labour. Or else, you shall have to pass a restless night.","General Information

9,"An old man, very rich, was puzzled because he had three sons; the problem was that all three sons were born simultaneously, their age was the same. Otherwise, in the East, the eldest son, inherits. The problem for the old man was who was going to inherit, because all these three were of the same age.
He asked a wise man, “What should I do? How should I decide who should inherit?” The old wise man gave him a certain method. The old man went home, he gave one thousand silver pieces to each son and told them, “Go to the market, purchase seeds of flowers.”
They went, they purchased seeds. Carts and carts came, full of seeds, because one thousand silver pieces in ancient days was big money, and just flower seeds …. When all the flower seeds had come, all that the three had bought, they said, “Now?”
Their father said, “I am going on a pilgrimage. It may take one year, two years, three years. You have to keep these seeds with you, and when I come back I will ask for the seeds to be given to me. And this is going to be a test also, because whosoever proves wise will inherit my whole property, so be careful.” He went on the pilgrimage.
The first son thought, “This is a strange test. If he comes after three years … these seeds will simply die, and he will ask for the living seeds. So the best way is to sell them in the market, keep the money, and when he comes back purchase new seeds again — fresh, young.” Very economical, mathematical — he did that.
The second son thought, “What this brother is doing is not right, does not seem to be right, because our father emphatically said, `These same seeds I would like to be returned.’ So I will keep these seeds.” He made arrangements in the basement of the house, put all the seeds there, locked it, and said, “Now whenever he comes I will give him the key and say, `These are the seeds.'”
But the third one had a different idea. He said, “Seeds kept in a basement will not remain alive; they need soil. By the time our father returns they will not be the same seeds because they will be dead. They cannot sprout — how can you call them the same seeds? The seeds that our father has given us can sprout, can become trees. One seed can produce millions of seeds; that is what he has given. And when he comes after three years those seeds will not be able to produce a single seed, a single sprout. This is not the way.”
He went behind their house — they had much land — and he sowed the seeds all over the land. Each year they became a thousandfold more. After three years when the father came, he could not believe his eyes — as far as he could see his whole land was full of flowers! He asked the other sons …. They had certainly failed the test.

10,"A martial arts student went to his teacher and said earnestly, “I am devoted to studying your martial system. How long will it take me to master it?”
The teacher’s reply was casual, “Ten years.”
Impatiently, the student answered, “But I want to master it faster than that. I will work very hard. I will practice everyday, ten or more hours a day if I have to. How long will it take then?”
The teacher thought for a moment, “20 years.”
Of course, this Zen story is not only about martial arts. It echoes the Law of Reversed Effort which suggests that the more we strive for something, the least likely we are to attain it. The martial arts student’s commitment is commendable. But the teacher probably saw it as a close-minded hindrance. Jeopardising the student’s ability to keep his beginner’s mind; to do everything as if he was doing it for the first time.","General Information

11,"The Bodhisattva’s [person on the path to enlightenment] way is called “the single-minded way,” or “one railway track thousands of miles long.” The railway track is always the same. If it were to become wider or narrower, it would be disastrous. Wherever you go, the railway track is always the same. That is the Bodhisattva’s way. So even if the sun were to rise from the west, the Bodhisattva has only one way. His way is in each moment to express his nature and his sincerity.

We say railway track, but actually there is no such thing. Sincerity itself is the railway track. The sights we see from the train will change, but we are always running on the same track. And there is no beginning or end to the track: beginningless and endless track. There is no starting point nor goal, nothing to attain. Just to run on the track is our way. This is the nature of our Zen practice.

But when you become curious about the railway track, danger is there. You should not see the railway track. If you look at the track you will become dizzy. Just appreciate the sights you see from the train. That is our way. There is no need for the passengers to be curious about the track. Someone will take care of it; Buddha will take care of it.

But sometimes we try to explain the railway track because we become curious if something is always the same. We wonder, “How is it possible for the Bodhisattva always to be the same? What is his secret?” But there is no secret. Everyone has the same nature as the railway track.

Shunryū Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind
Suzuki describes how consistent focus on what we do in any given moment leads to better outcomes. We’ve all experienced this in one way or another. We’re in a state of flow. But only as long as we don’t think too much about it. If you play an instrument, you know what happens when you start second-guessing your ability to play a difficult passage. The same happens during public speaking when we suddenly become hyper-aware of our audience and how they might judge us. So to keep the eternal flow, don’t try to explain it.","General Information

13,"The pupils of the Tendai school used to study meditation before Zen entered Japan. Four of them who were intimate friends promised one another to observe seven days of silence.

On the first day all were silent. Their meditation had begun auspiciously, but when night came and the oil lamps were growing dim one of the pupils could not help exclaiming to a servant: “Fix those lamps.”

The second pupil was surprised to hear the first one talk. “We are not supposed to say a word,” he remarked.

“You two are stupid. Why did you talk?” asked the third.

“I am the only one who has not talked,” concluded the fourth pupil.

This Zen parable is not only a story about silence but also about oneupmanship. How many of us would know when to quit and be able to actually do it? As someone who – on occasion – likes to hear himself talk, I’m not prepared to answer this question. But if enough people took this story to heart, it could be a serious threat to Twitter’s business model.","General Information

14,"If you go to a Zen teacher and you approach him in the traditional way, the first thing he will do is to say: “I haven’t anything to teach. Go away!”

“Well,” you say, “what are these people doing around here? Aren’t they your students?”

“They’re working with me, but unfortunately, we are very poor these days, we don’t have enough rice to go around to make ends meet.”

So you have to insist to be taken in. Every postulant for Zen training assumes immediately that the teacher has given him the brush off in order to test his sincerity. In other words: “If you really want this thing, you gotta work for it.”

That isn’t the real point. The point is that you got to make such a fuss to get in that you cannot withdraw gracefully after having made such a fuss to get in. Because you put yourself on the spot. And you define yourself as somebody needing help or as somebody with a problem who needs a master in order to be helped out of the problem.

Alan Watts
I think what Alan Watts is trying to say is that many of our problems are self-imposed. This is why Zen has nothing to offer since we cannot attain what we already have.

17,"Poseidon was sitting at his desk working. The administration of all the waters was a huge task. He could have had as many assistants as he wanted, and in fact he did have a large staff, but since he took his job very seriously and went through all the calculations himself anyway, assistants were of little use to him.

One couldn’t say that the work made him happy either; he only did it because it was his to do. Yes, he had often requested happier work, as he put it, but whenever they came back to him with suggestions, it turned out that nothing appealed to him as much as what he was doing. It was actually very difficult to find anything else for him.

It was hardly possible to put him in charge of a particular sea, quite apart from the fact that the calculations involved were no less onerous, just more trivial, since great Poseidon was only ever in line for an executive post. And if he was offered a job in a different department, the very thought of it was enough to turn his stomach, his divine breath became restless, his bronze thorax quaked.

Not that they took his complaints all that seriously: if a great power kicks up, then you have to be seen to give into him, even in the most hopeless cause; no one seriously thought of having Poseidon removed from office, he had been god of the seas from the beginning of time, and would have to remain such.

The thing that most angered him — and this was the principal cause of his unhappiness in his job — was when he got to hear what people thought it involved, that is, forever parting the waves with his trident. And when all the time he was sitting at the bottom of the ocean up to his ears in figures, the occasional visit to Jupiter was really the only break in the monotony; a visit, moreover, from which he usually returned in a towering bad temper.

He hardly ever clapped eyes on the seas, only fleetingly on his hurried way up to Olympus, and he had never sailed them as such. He tended to say he was waiting for the world to end first, because there was bound to be a quiet moment just before the end when he had signed off on his last calculation and would be able to take himself on a little cruise somewhere.

Citizens were paid a small amount of money for each rat they killed. However, given the health risks, the colonial government didn’t want piles of rat corpses to be handed over to officials.

So instead they paid locals for every rat tail they brought in. The tails soon became an object of value. The rat hunters soon realised that they didn’t have to kill the rodents. A released rat with a cut-off tail could breed again and produce more valuable tails. Needless to say, the bounty failed to achieve the desired results. The rat plague was now worse than before.

One day the son got so frustrated by this, that he built a wood coffin, dragged it over to the porch, and told his father to get in. Without saying anything, the father climbed inside. After closing the lid, the son dragged the coffin to the edge of the farm where there was a high cliff.

As he approached the drop, he heard a light tapping on the lid from inside the coffin. He opened it up. Still lying there peacefully, the father looked up at his son: “I know you are going to throw me over the cliff, but before you do, may I suggest something?” “What is it?” replied the son. “Throw me over the cliff, if you like,” said the father, “but save this good wood coffin. Your children might need to use it.”

21,"The Shepherd’s Boy and the Wolf is a classic story with a moral about lying. It’s the original moral story of the common phrase to cry wolf.

A shepherd-boy, who watched a flock of sheep near a village, brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out, “Wolf! Wolf!” and when his neighbors came to help him, laughed at them for their pains. The Wolf, however, did truly come at last. The Shepherd-boy, now really alarmed, shouted in an agony of terror: “Pray, do come and help me; the Wolf is killing the sheep;” but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor rendered any assistance. The Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his leisure lacerated or destroyed the whole flock.

There is no believing a liar, even when he speaks the truth.

22,"St George in Retirement is a story about obsession. It’s a variation of the legend of St George and the dragon and was penned by Australian philosopher Kenny Minogue to illustrate the history of liberalism.

After many centuries of hopelessness and superstition, St. George, in the guise of Rationality, appeared in the world somewhere about the sixteenth century. The first dragons upon whom he turned his lance were those of despotic kingship and religious intolerance.

These battles won, he rested for a time, until such questions as slavery, or prison conditions, or the state of the poor, began to command his attention. During the nineteenth century, his lance was never still, prodding this way and that against the inert scaliness of privilege, vested interest, or patrician insolence.

But, unlike St. George, he did not know when to retire. The more he succeeded, the more he became bewitched with the thought of a world free of dragons, and the less capable he became of ever returning to private life. He needed his dragons. He could only live by fighting for causes—the people, the poor, the exploited, the colonially oppressed, the underprivileged and the underdeveloped.

As an ageing warrior, he grew breathless in his pursuit of smaller and smaller dragons — for the big dragons were now harder to come by.

Kenny Minogue, The Liberal Mind
The moral of the story: Not knowing when to quit is the first step of the descent into madness. Beware of St. George in Retirement Syndrome, the obsession with pursuing a laudable goal.",,
23,"One day, one of the Buddha’s disciples asked Buddha some big questions. He asked, “What happens after we die? And if God is real?” The Buddha was silent for a moment and then he said, “Imagine you’re walking in the forest by yourself and all of a sudden somebody shoots and arrow and it hits you. What would you do in this situation? Would you hurry to a nearby village to get help to patch the wound, stop the bleeding and save your life? Or would you stay still and wonder who shot the arrow? What was the arrow made of? How fast was the arrow traveling? What would you do?” And the disciple answered, “Well master, of course I would go to a nearby village to get help to stop the bleeding.” And the Buddha replied, “We not necessarily have all the responses to the mysteries of life but one thing we do know for certain, is that life has suffering. And unless we seek out the wisdom to heal our wounds, we will bleed to death wondering about things that we may never get an answer to.”",,
24,"One day the Buddha was traveling with his disciples and it was a very hot day. So they decided to take a break near a lake and get some water to drink. When one of his disciples went to fetch the water, he noticed that the water was very murky due to some recent disturbance. He came back to the Buddha and reported the news to him. And the Buddha said, “Just wait one hour and go back to the same lake.” And on the second time, the disciple saw the water had become completely clear. And he came back to the Buddha in a joyous mood with some drinking water. And the Buddha asked, “How did you manage to tackle the problem of the muddy water? You did nothing. You just waited and the water cleared on its own. Just like the muddy water that is unsuitable that is unsuitable for consumption, so is a disturbed mind unsuitable for usage. Even the muddiest water will get clear with time. And so even the most disturbed mind will return to its calm state with time",,
25,"One day a powerful and wealthy man went to visit a Zen temple. He heard rumours about a Zen master who was said to be the wisest man in the land. Upon meeting the master, the man said, “Teach me about Zen.” The Zen Master smiled and said, “Let’s have this conversation over a cup of tea.” And so the Zen master started pouring out tea. He filled up the man’s cup but he continued to pour. He kept pouring and pouring and the tea spilled all over the place. The man said, “Enough! Stop! Can’t you see you’re spilling the tea everywhere?” And the Zen master said, “You see, that’s like your mind. In order to learn about Zen, you first need to empty your mind just like this cup.” The lesson here is that all of us have preconceived ideas about the things that we want to learn. True wisdom is understanding that you actually no nothing. In order to grasp something, to learn something new, we first need to open our hands, we first need to open our minds and we first need to let go.",,
26,"Samir, a young lad known for his mischievous nature and love for adventure, heard fascinating stories about a wise and enlightened person called the Buddha. The Buddha resided in a nearby monastery, which piqued Samir’s curiosity. Eager to explore, he embarked on a long expedition through forests, valleys, and mountains to reach the revered monastery. Approaching the Buddha with respect, Samir asked, “Honourable Master, how can one find true happiness?” The Buddha smiled gently and replied, “Ah, happiness, my young friend, cannot be found externally. It lies within oneself. True contentment is discovered by letting go of desires and attachments.” Perplexed, Samir further inquired, “But how can I give up desires when they bring me joy?” The Buddha, radiating wisdom, explained that desires are like unquenchable flames that consume us. They create an insatiable hunger that can never be satisfied. True happiness comes from understanding the impermanence of things and realizing that genuine joy blossoms from within. Deep in thought, Samir gradually grasped the profound truth behind the Buddha’s teachings. The moral of the story is that true happiness comes from within and not from external possessions or desires. When we learn to let go of our attachments and find contentment in the present moment, we can experience lasting joy and peace.",,
27,"Two monks were walking along a path when they came to a river. The river was swollen with rain and the current was strong. One monk decided to take off his clothes and wade across the river. The other monk watched in amazement. “Why are you taking off your clothes?” he asked. “You don’t know to swim.” The first monk said, “I don’t need to swim. “I’m going to cross the river on foot.” The second monk didn’t understand. “But how can you do that?” he asked, “The current is too strong.” “I don’t need to fight the current,” the first monk said. “I will simply let it carry me.” The second monk watched as the first monk stepped into the river and let the current carry him across. When the first monk reached the other side, he turned to the second monk and said, “It is the same with life. If we try to fight against the current, we will only struggle. But if we let go and let the current carry us, we will reach our destination. What did this story teach you? ",,
28,"A farmer got so old that he couldn’t work the fields anymore. So he would spend the day just sitting on the porch. His son, still working the farm, would look up from time to time and see his father sitting there.

“He’s of no use any more,” the son thought to himself, “he doesn’t do anything!” One day the son got so frustrated by this, that he built a wood coffin, dragged it over to the porch, and told his father to get in.

Without saying anything, the father climbed inside. After closing the lid, the son dragged the coffin to the edge of the farm where there was a high cliff.

As he approached the drop, he heard a light tapping on the lid from inside the coffin. He opened it up. Still lying there peacefully, the father looked up at his son. “I know you are going to throw me over the cliff, but before you do, may I suggest something?” “What is it?” replied the son. “Throw me over the cliff, if you like,” said the father, “but save this good wood coffin. Your children might need to use it.”",,
29," A Zen Master who, while out walking one day, is confronted by a ferocious, man-eating tiger. He slowly backs away from the animal, only to find that he is trapped at the edge of a high cliff; the tiger snarls with hunger, and pursues the Master. His only hope of escape is to suspend himself over the abyss by holding onto a vine that grows at its edge. As the Master dangles from the cliff, two mice – one white and one black – begin to gnaw on the vine he is clutching on. If he climbs back up, the tiger will surely devour him, if he stays then there is the certain death of a long fall onto the jagged rocks. The slender vine begins to give way, and death is imminent. Just then the precariously suspended Zen Master notices a lovely ripe wild strawberry growing along the cliff’s edge. He plucks the succulent berry and pops it into his mouth. He is heard to say: “This lovely strawberry, how sweet it tastes.”",,
30,"A scholar went to visit Lao Tzu to learn from him. The scholar talked incessantly about all he knew, leaving no space for Lao Tzu to speak. Lao Tzu listened quietly for a while, then poured tea for the scholar. He poured until the cup overflowed and continued pouring. The scholar, unable to restrain himself, exclaimed, ""Stop! The cup is overflowing, no more will go in!"" Lao Tzu stopped pouring and said, ""Like this cup, you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I teach you unless you first empty your cup?""

This story illustrates the importance of being open to new learning and experiences. To gain wisdom, one must first make space by letting go of preconceptions and the need to be the one who knows.",,
31,"Zen teachers train their young pupils to express themselves. Two Zen temples each had a child protégé. One child, going to obtain vegetables each morning, would meet the other on the way.
“Where are you going?” asked the one.
“I am going wherever my feet go,” the other responded.
This reply puzzled the first child who went to his teacher for help. “Tomorrow morning,” the teacher told him, “when you meet that little fellow, ask him the same question. He will give you the same answer, and then you ask him: ‘Suppose you have no feet, then where are you going?’ That will fix him.”
The children met again the following morning.
“Where are you going?” asked the first child.
“I am going wherever the wind blows,” answered the other. This again nonplussed the youngster, who took his defeat to his teacher.
“Ask him where he is going if there is no wind,” suggested the teacher.
The next day the children met a third time.
“Where are you going?” asked the first child.
“I am going to the market to buy vegetables,” the other replied.",,
32,"Once two Zen monks were walking together along a muddy road. A heavy rain was still falling. Coming around a bend they met an attractive young girl in a silk kimono and sash, unable to cross the intersection because of a big puddle of mud in her way. The girl asked if one of them could lift her across. The younger one said “Certainly not, my vows preclude my touching a woman.” The older monk simply picked her up and carried her over the mud. The two monks walked on in silence for some time. Finally, the younger one spoke: “I cannot get over the fact that you carried that woman across the mud. Have you no sense of propriety, no self discipline?”
The older one asked: “What did I do when I reached the other side?”
The younger one answered: “You put her down.”
“Exactly,” said the older monk, “And you are still carrying her!”",,
33,"One day a young Buddhist on his journey home came to the banks of a wide river. Staring hopelessly at the great obstacle in front of him, he pondered for hours on just how to cross such a wide barrier. Just as he was about to give up his pursuit to continue his journey he saw a great teacher on the other side of the river. The young Buddhist yells over to the teacher, “Oh wise one, can you tell me how to get to the other side of this river”? The teacher ponders for a moment looks up and down the river and yells back, “My son, you are on the other side”.",,
34,"When Mamiya, who later became a well-known preacher, went to a teacher for personal guidance, he was asked to explain the sound of one hand. Mamiya concentrated upon what the sound of one hand might be. “You are not working hard enough,” his teacher told him. “You are too attached to food, wealth, things, and that sound. It would be better if you died. That would solve the problem.” The next time Mamiya appeared before his teacher he was again asked what he had to show regarding the sound of one hand. Mamiya at once fell over as if he were dead.
“You are dead all right,” observed the teacher. “But how about that sound?”
“I haven’t solved that yet,” replied Mamiya, looking up.
“Dead men do not speak,” said the teacher. “Get out!”",,
35,"Once two Zen monks were walking down the road. It was a breezy day. One of them said to the other: “Look, the flag is flapping in the breeze.” The second monk replied: “No, that is foolish. The breeze is flapping the flag!” And so they spent an exciting quarter hour: “The flag is flapping!”
“The breeze is flapping!”
As the debate was heating up, the Zen master appeared on the road. They ran to him. “Roshi, please settle our dispute. I say the flag is flapping in the breeze, he says the breeze is flapping the flag. Which one of us is right?” The master looked at them with a penetrating eye. “You are both wrong,” he said. “Your minds are flapping!”",,
36,"Suiwo, the disciple of Hakuin, was a good teacher. During one summer seclusion period, a pupil came to him from a southern island of Japan. Suiwo gave him the problem: “Hear the sound of one hand.” The pupil remained three years but could not pass the test. One night he came in tears to Suiwo. “I must return south in shame and embarrassment,” he said, “for I cannot solve my problem.”
“Wait one week more and meditate constantly,” advised Suiwo. Still no enlightenment came to the pupil. “Try for another week,” said Suiwo. The pupil obeyed, but in vain. “Still another week.” Yet this was of no avail. In despair the student begged to be released, but Suiwo requested another meditation of five days. They were without result. Then he said: “Meditate for three days longer, then if you fail to attain enlightenment, you had better kill yourself.” On the second day the pupil was enlightened.",,
37,"After Bankei had passed away, a blind man who lived near the master’s temple told a friend: “Since I am blind, I cannot watch a person’s face, so I must judge his character by the sound of his voice. Ordinarily when I hear someone congratulate another upon his happiness or success, I also hear a secret tone of envy. When condolence is expressed for the misfortune of another, I hear pleasure and satisfaction, as if the one condoling was really glad there was something left to gain in his own world. “In all my experience, however, Bankei’s voice was always sincere. Whenever he expressed happiness, I heard nothing but happiness, and whenever he expressed sorrow, sorrow was all I heard.”",,
38,"Zen students are with their masters at least two years before they presume to teach others. Nan-in was visited by Tenno, who, having passed his apprenticeship, had become a teacher. The day happened to be rainy, so Tenno wore wooden clogs and carried an umbrella. After greeting him Nan-in remarked: “I suppose you left your wooden clogs in the vestibule. I want to know if your umbrella is on the right or left side of the clogs.” Tenno, confused, had no instant answer. He realised that he was unable to carry his Zen every minute. He became Nan-in’s pupil, and he studied six more years to accomplish his every-minute Zen.",,
39,"A great Japanese warrior named Nobunaga decided to attack the enemy although he had only one-tenth the number of men the opposition commanded. He knew that he would win, but his soldiers were in doubt. On the way he stopped at a Shinto shrine and told his men: “After I visit the shrine I will toss a coin. If heads comes, we will win; if tails, we will lose. Destiny holds us in her hand.”
Nobunaga entered the shrine and offered a silent prayer. He came forth and tossed a coin. Heads appeared. His soldiers were so eager to fight that they won their battle easily.
“No one can change the hand of destiny,” his attendant told him after the battle.
“Indeed not,” said Nobunaga, showing a coin which had been doubled, with heads facing either way.",,
40,"A man was rowing his boat upstream on a very misty morning. Suddenly, another boat appeared, coming downstream toward him. It seemed as if the other boat was aiming directly for him at great speed. Angered and fearful of a collision, he began to shout insults at the other boat and prepared himself for impact. However, as the boat came closer, he saw that it was empty.

This moment of realization changed his anger to laughter, and his curse turned into a sigh of relief. The empty boat became a metaphor for the nature of grievances and misunderstandings in life. Lao Tzu used this story to teach that the source of our troubles is often our own expectations and ego. When we encounter an ""empty boat"" — a situation that we interpret through our expectations and desires — we may react with unnecessary emotion. By perceiving the emptiness, we can find peace and act with clarity.",,
41,"A master potter was explaining to his apprentice the secret of making a perfect pot. He said, ""It is the space inside the pot that makes it useful. The usefulness of the pot comes from what is not there."" This puzzled the apprentice, so the master took him to a window and said, ""Look outside. What do you see?"" The apprentice replied, ""I see trees, houses, and the sky."" The master asked, ""And what do you see in between?"" The apprentice, confused, said, ""Nothing."" The master then explained, ""It is the emptiness that holds everything together. Just like the space inside the pot, it is the nothingness that makes everything useful.""

This story illustrates the Taoist concept of the value of emptiness, teaching that absence and presence together create the whole.",,
42,"There was a large tree with twisted branches and a rugged trunk. Its wood was too strong and knotty to be cut into lumber, so it was left standing alone while the trees around it were chopped down. A wise man sat beneath it one day, and the tree spoke to him, lamenting its uselessness. The wise man laughed and said, ""You are not useless. You have provided shade for people and animals for many years. Your strength has protected you, and your uniqueness has given you a long life. What you thought made you worthless has actually been your greatest asset.""

This story teaches us about recognizing and valuing our innate qualities, even those we or others might deem as flaws. It's a lesson in the wisdom of being true to one’s nature, a core principle in Taoism.",,
43,"Lao Tzu once passed by a garden where he stopped to admire the roses in bloom. A young gardener saw him and said, ""Master, how do you find the fragrance of our roses?"" Lao Tzu replied, ""The fragrance is wonderful, but it is not the roses that create the perfume."" Confused, the gardener asked for an explanation. Lao Tzu explained, ""The fragrance does not come from doing, but from being. Just as your own peace and happiness do not come from what you do, but from what you are.""

This story highlights the Taoist principle of ziran, or naturalness, suggesting that the most profound qualities arise naturally, without force or artificial effort.",,
44,"A man found a precious stone in a stream. The next day he met a traveler who was hungry, and the man opened his bag to share his food. The hungry traveler saw the precious stone and asked the man to give it to him. The man did so without hesitation. The traveler left, rejoicing in his good fortune. He knew the stone was worth enough to give him security for a lifetime. But a few days later, he came back to return the stone to the wise man. ""I’ve been thinking,"" he said, ""I know how valuable the stone is, but I give it back in the hope that you can give me something even more precious. Give me what you have within you that enabled you to give me the stone.""

The story emphasizes the value of generosity and the wealth within, which surpasses even the most valuable physical possessions.",,
45,"A young man sought wisdom and heard of a sage who lived by the river. Upon finding him, the young man asked, ""Oh wise one, what is the secret to becoming wise?"" The sage stood up, took the young man by the hand, and led him into the river. Suddenly, the sage plunged the young man's head under water and held him there until he struggled for air. Gasping, the young man emerged, and the sage asked, ""While you were under, what did you want more than anything?"" The young man replied, ""Air, more than anything, I wanted air."" The sage said, ""When you desire wisdom as much as you desired air when you were submerged, you will find it.""

This narrative underscores the intensity of desire needed to attain true wisdom, highlighting that the quest for knowledge must be pursued with the same urgency and necessity as the basic need to breathe.",,
46,"A businessman saw a fisherman lying lazily beside his boat, enjoying the sun. ""Why aren't you out fishing?"" asked the businessman. The fisherman replied, ""Because I've caught enough fish for the day."" The businessman then asked, ""Why don’t you catch more than you need?"" The fisherman asked, ""What would I do with it?"" The businessman said, ""You could earn more money, buy a better boat, go into deeper waters, and catch more fish. Then you could buy nylon nets, catch even more fish, and make more money. Soon you’d have a fleet of boats and be rich like me."" The fisherman asked, ""Then what?"" The businessman replied, ""Then you could sit down and enjoy life."" The fisherman smiled and said, ""What do you think I’m doing right now?""

This tale illustrates the Taoist values of contentment and simplicity, questioning the relentless pursuit of progress and material wealth at the expense of present happiness and well-being.",,
47,"The Zen master Hakuin was praised by his neighbors as one living a pure life. A beautiful Japanese girl whose parents owned a food store lived near him. Suddenly, without any warning, her parents discovered she was with child.

This made her parents angry. She would not confess who the man was, but after much harassment at last named Hakuin. In great anger, the parents went to the master. ""Is that so?"" was all he would say.

After the child was born, it was brought to Hakuin. By this time, he had lost his reputation, which did not trouble him, but he took very good care of the child. A year later, the girl-mother could stand it no longer. She told her parents the truth - that the real father of the child was a young man who worked in the fish market.

The mother and father of the girl at once went to Hakuin to ask his forgiveness, to apologize at length, and to get the child back. Hakuin was willing. In yielding the child, all he said was: ""Is that so?""

Lesson: Acceptance and non-attachment. Hakuin’s response to both accusation and resolution reflects a deep acceptance of life's fluctuations without attaching to blame or praise.",,
48,"A wise farmer had a donkey that fell into an old, dry well. After many attempts to retrieve the donkey, the farmer decided it was impossible and thought it would be more humane to bury the old donkey in the well and put it out of its misery. As the farmer and his neighbors shoveled dirt into the well, the donkey felt the load, shook it off, and took a step up. With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey did the same thing: he would shake it off and take a step up. Eventually, the donkey stepped over the edge of the well and trotted off.

The story teaches resilience in the face of adversity. Instead of giving up when faced with challenges, we should shake them off and use them as stepping stones to rise above",,
49,"Yamaoka Tesshu, as a young student of Zen, visited one master after another. He called upon Dokuon of Shokoku.

Desiring to show his attainment, he said: ""The mind, Buddha, and sentient beings, after all, do not exist. The true nature of phenomena is emptiness. There is no realization, no delusion, no sage, no mediocrity. There is no giving and nothing to be received.""

Dokuon, who was smoking quietly, said nothing. Suddenly he whacked Yamaoka with his bamboo pipe. This made the youth quite angry.

""If nothing exists,"" inquired Dokuon, ""where did this anger come from?""

Lesson: This story highlights the dangers of intellectualism and dogma in spirituality. True understanding cannot be reached through mere words or intellectualization; it must be experienced firsthand, often beyond the confines of structured thought.",,
50,"A man once approached the Buddha and began insulting him. The Buddha remained calm and asked the man, “If someone refuses to accept a gift, to whom does the gift belong?” The man answered, “It belongs to the person who offered it.” The Buddha then said, “I refuse to accept your insults and ask you to keep them with yourself.” This story teaches the power of equanimity and not reacting to negativity with negativity.",,
